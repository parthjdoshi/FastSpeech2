I am going out for dinner today.
How are you?
The professor will discuss a new topic today.
It's a cloudy day.
I am going home in a few hours.
I am extremely happy today!
It's such a beautiful morning!
The trip was amazing.
I love the food at that Italian restaurant!
Don't you love it when a plan comes together?
I hate you and everything you stand for!
I wish I'd never met you!
Do you even understand anything about this project?
This mistake will not go unpunished!
That was extremely rude of you!
I miss my mother everyday.
I wish I could see her again.
I am sorry about the spoilt meal.
We should have done better on the project.
I apologize for my behavior.
